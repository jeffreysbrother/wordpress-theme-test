#WordPress Theme Test#

I created this project as I was following along with the WordPress theme development tutorial available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OBfr46Y0cQ&list=PLpcSpRrAaOaqMA4RdhSnnNcaqOVpX7qi5). The purpose was not to create a production-ready site, but to simply learn about some important aspects of theme development. If you're interested in this type of thing, please visit the link above---the tutorial is excellent for the person who already knows a little WordPress and PHP.
